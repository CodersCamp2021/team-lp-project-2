## How to Use

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Overview

Population of Earth is now at almost 2 years of pandemic and constant lockdowns. Prices are at all-time high, inflation is skyrocketing, noone is happy.
There is one group of people that's particularly unhappy and opressed - gamers. The cryptocurrency boom feels like it's been lasting forever
with PC parts costing a fortune (graphics cards being prime example). Worldwide microchips shortages are definitely playing a big part in it and there's no obvious solution in sight.
The story would end here... **HOWEVER!**

One day a rift has opened in a certain part of Poland, near Wrocław. It was discovered to contain a massive deposits of **silicon** and was promptly turned into a mine. As to what the place was called, a term **Silicon Alley** was coined by an anonymous entity and seemingly the PC part crisis was solved... or was it?

The amount of electronics produced (as well as the demand for them) ended up being so gigantic that all the stores couldn't handle every consumer order and a need for yet another electronics store arose. And that is how this project came to be.

## Project Assumptions

The main assumption of the project is to create an application through the appropriate use of the React knowledge acquired during the course.

A six-person design group, under the guidance of a mentor, who is also a customer of the product, decided on the subject of the store. The store contains computer components.

The store has several categories with components for computers that the user can add to the cart and complete the transaction.

The customer who makes the purchase can also filter the products, including by price.

The store project is just an example of how an actual store works. It allows us to consolidate the previously acquired knowledge and apply it in practice.
