## **Overview**

Population of Earth is now at almost 2 years of pandemic and constant lockdowns. Prices are at all-time high, inflation is skyrocketing, noone is happy.
There is one group of people that's particularly unhappy and opressed - gamers. The cryptocurrency boom feels like it's been lasting forever
with PC parts costing a fortune (graphics cards being prime example). Worldwide microchips shortages are definitely playing a big part in it and there's no obvious solution in sight.
The story would end here... **HOWEVER!**

One day a rift has opened in a certain part of Poland, near Wrocław. It was discovered to contain a massive deposits of **silicon** and was promptly turned into a mine. As to what the place was called, a term **Silicon Alley** was coined by an anonymous entity and seemingly the PC part crisis was solved... or was it?

The amount of electronics produced (as well as the demand for them) ended up being so gigantic that all the stores couldn't handle every consumer order and a need for yet another electronics store arose. And that is how this project came to be.

**!! IMPORTANT !!**

The backend team responsible for the server managed to finish their work very quickly. However, once they completed their tasks, they've gone dark on us. So for now, we don't have any control over what happens on the backend. Keep that in mind when requesting new features for the shop!

## Project Assumptions

The main assumption of the project is to create an application through the appropriate use of the React knowledge acquired during the course.

A six-person design group, under the guidance of a mentor, who is also a customer of the product, decided on the subject of the store. The store contains computer components.

The store has several categories with components for computers that the user can add to the cart and (seemingly) complete the transaction.

The customer who makes the purchase can also filter the products, including category, price and brand filters.

The store project is just an example of how an actual store works. It allows us to consolidate the previously acquired knowledge and apply it in practice.
